To get the results of fuselage shape prediction, please run "case_result.m". This code will generate three plots:

Figure 1: Predictive RMSE of LFGP, LFGP-IC, BLM, FPCM and BK for the composite fuselage shape in irregular grid condition, 
Figure 2: Predictive RMSE of LFGP, LFGP-IC, BLM, FPCM and BK for the composite fuselage shape in regular grid condition, 
Figure 3: The fitting curve of the composite fuselage shape by LFGP.

The detailed predictive RMSE in Figure 1 can be obtained from LFGP\cvrmse_random, LFGP_id\cvrmse_random, BLM\cvrmse_BSPL_1, FPCM\cvrmse_FPCA_1, and BK\cvrmse_kriging_1.

The detailed predictive RMSE in Figure 2 can be obtained from LFGP\cvrmse_fixed, LFGP_id\cvrmse_fixed, BLM\cvrmse_BSPL_2, FPCM\cvrmse_FPCA_2, and BK\cvrmse_kriging_2.
