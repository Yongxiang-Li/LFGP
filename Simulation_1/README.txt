To get the results of the first simulation, please run "simulation1_result.m". This code will generate two box line plots:

Figure 1: Predictive RMSE of LFGP, LFGP-IC, BLM, FPCM and BK for general functional outputs in irregular grid condition, 
Figure 2: Predictive RMSE of LFGP, LFGP-IC, BLM, FPCM and BK for general functional outputs in regular grid condition.


Here, in order to save time running simulation study, we have designed a demo to help readers to understand the detailed procedure of LFGP for general curves. Please run Demo\LFGP_random_demo and Demo\LFGP_fixed_demo to obtain the predictive curves and related results.


The predictive RMSE in Figure 1 can be obtained from LFGP_Code\cvrmse_random, LFGP_Code_id\cvrmse_random, BLM_Code\cvrmse_BSPL_1, FPCM_Code\cvrmse_FPCA_1, and BK_Code\cvrmse_kriging_1.
The predictive RMSE in Figure 2 can be obtained from LFGP_Code\cvrmse_fixed, LFGP_Code_id\cvrmse_fixed, BLM_Code\cvrmse_BSPL_2, FPCM_Code\cvrmse_FPCA_2, and BK_Code\cvrmse_kriging_2.
