To get the results of the second simulation, please run "simulation2_result.m". This code will generate two box line plots:

Figure 1: Predictive RMSE of LFGP, LFGP-IC, BLM, FPCM and BK for closed curves in irregular grid condition.
Figure 2: Predictive RMSE of LFGP, LFGP-IC, BLM, FPCM and BK for closed curves in regular grid condition.


Here, in order to save time running simulation study, we have designed a demo to help readers to understand the detailed procedure of LFGP for closed curves. Please run Demo\LFGP_CLOSED_Demo to obtain the predictive curves and related results.


The predictive RMSE in Figure 1 can be obtained from LFGP_CLOSED_Code\cvrmse_random, LFGP_CLOSED_id_Code\cvrmse_random, BLM_Code\cvrmse_BSPL, FPCM_Code\cvrmse_FPCA, and BK_Code\cvrmse_kriging.
The predictive RMSE in Figure 2 can be obtained from LFGP_CLOSED_Code\cvrmse_fixed, LFGP_CLOSED_id_Code\cvrmse_fixed, BLM_Code\cvrmse_BSPL1, FPCM_Code\cvrmse_FPCA1, and BK_Code\cvrmse_kriging1.
